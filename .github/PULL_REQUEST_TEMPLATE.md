# Pull Request Guide
The following should be included with each PR.

* A reasonable merge title that is quick and at first glace can tell what was worked on in the differing branch.
* A semi-detailed description of the work that was done and what could be improved based on what was implemented in the current feature.
* If there are multiple developers for any reason:
    * Assign a review to look over code in a PR.
    * Assign appropriate Assignees
    * Add appropriate labels as needed.
* Ensure that PR is pointing towards master branch: `base:master <- compare: <branch-name>`
